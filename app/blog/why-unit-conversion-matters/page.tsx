          Unit conversion is a fundamental skill that impacts many aspects of
          our daily routines. Whether youâ€™re following a recipe that uses grams
          instead of ounces, planning a road trip in a country that measures
          distance in kilometers, or shopping for groceries with different
          volume units, accurate conversions ensure you get the results you
          expect.
